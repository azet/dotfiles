# TODO

## Add CLI Colors to inline status messages

`> this is going on ..`
should be colored

some output ommitted and written into /tmp text files

## GPG Verification

currently turned off due to issues with GPG smard cards, the WOT eco system and so forth.
to enable potentially in the future:

1. enable signed commits in the .gitconfig (disabled via comment)
2. enable git verify-commit in the `update` script (disabled via comment)
